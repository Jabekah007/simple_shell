.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
This is a simple shell program written in C that enables interaction with a Linux operating system.

.SH SYNOPSIS
 hsh [options] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
A shell is a user interface in UNIX that interacts with the operating system by interpreting and executing the commands entered by a user.
It is often referred to as a command interpreter and typically presents an interface with a specific command syntax.


.B Overview
The simple shell is a program that can read lines from either a file or the terminal, interpret them, and execute other commands. It is typically launched when
a user logs into a system and offers numerous features to facilitate interactive use. One of its advantages is that the interpretative language is shared by both
interactive and non-interactive use (such as shell scripts). This means that commands can be entered directly into the simple shell while it is running, or they
can be written to a file and executed by the simple shell directly.

.SH Return Value
The simple shell program returns 0 upon success and a non-zero value upon failure.

.SH PATH
It searches for executables in all directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
